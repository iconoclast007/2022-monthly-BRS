There are 260 chapters in the New Testament.  If you read five chapters in the New Testament each week, you will complete the New Testament in just under one year.  You will also read one chapter each from Genesis and Proverbs each week.  This will take you through the book of Genesis in 50 weeks and through the book of Proverbs one and two-thirds times.
