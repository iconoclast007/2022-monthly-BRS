\textbf{Genesis}
\end{center}
Genesis is the book of beginnings.  It records not only the beginning of the heavens and the earth, and of plant, animal, and human life, but also of human institutions and relationships.  Typically, it speaks of the new birth, the new creation, where all was chaos and ruin.  With Genesis begins also the progressive self-revelation of God which culminates in Christ.  Three primary names of deity, Elohim Jehovah, and Adonai, and the five most important of the compound names, occur in Genesis; and that in an ordered progression which could not be changed without confusion.  The problem of sin as affecting man's condition in the earth, and his relation to God, and the divine solution of that problem are here in essence.  Of the eight great covenants which condition human life and the divine redemption, four, the Edenic, Adamic, Noahic, and Abrahamic Covenants, are in this book; and these four are the fundamental covenants to which the other four, the Mosaic, Palestinian, Davidic, and New Covenants, are related chiefly as adding detail or development.  Genesis enters into the very structure of the New Testament, in which it is quoted above sixty times in seventeen books.  In a profound sense, therefore, the roots of all subsequent revelation are planted deep in Genesis, and whoever would truly comprehend that revelation must begin here.

\textbf{Exodus}
\end{center}
Exodus, ``going out,'' records the redemption out of Egyptian bondage of the descendants of Abraham, and sets forth, in type, all redemption. It is therefore peculiarly the book of redemption.  But as all redemption is unto a relationship with God of which worship, fellowship, and service are expressions, so Exodus, in the giving of the law and the provisions of sacrifice and priesthood, becomes not only the book of redemption, but also, in type, of the conditions upon which all relationships with God exist.  Broadly, the book teaches that redemption is essential to any relationship with a holy God; and that even a redeemed people cannot have fellowship with Him unless constantly cleansed from defilement.  In Exodus, God, hitherto connected the Israelitish people only through His covenant with Abraham, brings them to Himself \emph{nationally} through redemption, puts them under the Mosaic covenant, and dwells among them in the cloud of glory.  Galatians explains the relation of the law to the Abrahamic covenant.  In the Commandments God taught Israel His just demands.

\begin{center}
\textbf{Leviticus}
\end{center}
Leviticus stands in the same relation to Exodus, that the Epistles do to the Gospels.  Exodus is the record of redemption, and lays the foundation of the cleansing, worship, and service of a redeemed people.  Leviticus gives the detail of the walk, worship, and service of that people.  In Exodus God speaks out of the mount to which approach was forbidden; in Leviticus He speaks out of the tabernacles in which He dwells in the midst of His people, to tell them that which befits His holiness in their approach to, and communion with, Himself.  The key-word of Leviticus is holiness, occurring 87 times. Key-verse, 19:2.  Leviticus is in nine chief divisions: I. The Offering, 1:1 - 6:7.  II. The Law of the Offerings 6:8 - 7:38. III. Consecration, 8:1 - 9:24. IV. A Warning Example, 10:1 - 20.  V. A Holy God must have a Cleansed People, 11:1 - 15. VI. Atonement, 16 - 17. VII.  The Relationships of God's People, 18 - 22.  VIII. The Feasts of Jehovah, 23. IX. Instructions and Warnings, 24 - 27.
