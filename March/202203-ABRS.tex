\textbf{Deuteronomy}
\end{center}
DEUTERONOMY consists of the parting counsels of Moses delivered to Israel upon the impending entrance upon their covenanted possession. It is important to note that, while the land of promise was unconditionally given Abraham and to his seed in the Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 13:15 ; 15:7), it was under the conditional Palestinian Covenant (Deuteronomy 28:1-30:9) that Israel entered the land under Joshua. Utterly violating the conditions of that covenant, the nation was first disrupted (1 Kings 12) and then cast out of the land (2 Kings 17:1-18 ; 24:1-25:11). But the same covenant unconditionally promises a national restoration of Israel which is yet to be fulfilled (See Scofield).  The time covered by this retrospect is approximately forty years.

\textbf{Joshua}
\end{center}
JOSHUA records the consummation of the redemption of Israel of Israel out of Egypt; for redemption has two parts: ``out,'' and ``into'' (Deuteronomy 6:23). In a spiritual sense the book of Joshua is the Ephesians of the Old Testament. ``The heavenly'' of Ephesians is to the Christian what Canaan was to the Israelite and blessing through divine power (Joshua 21:43-55, Ephesians 1:3).

\textbf{Judges}
\end{center}
Judges takes its name from the thirteen men raised up to deliver Israel in the declension and disunion which followed the death of Joshua. Through these men Jehovah continued His personal government of Israel. The key-verse to the condition of Israel is (Judges 17:6), ``Every man did that which was right in his own eyes.'' Two facts stand out--the utter failure of Israel, and the persistent grace of Jehovah. In the choice of the Judges is illustrated Zechariah's great word (Zechariah 4:6), ``not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord''; and Paul's word (1 Corinthians 1:25), ``not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called.'' The book records seven apostasies, seven servitudes to seven heathen nations, seven deliverances. The spiritual parallel is found in the history of the professing church since the Apostles, in the rise of sects and the lost sense of the unity of the one body.

\textbf{Ruth}
\end{center}
Ruth should be read in connection with the first half of Judges, as it presents a picture of life in Israel at that time.  
Typically, the book may be taken as a foreview of the church (Ruth), as the Gentile bride of Christ, the Bethlehemite who is able to redeem. Ruth also gives a normal Christian experience: (1) Ruth deciding: 1, (2) Ruth serving: 2, (3) Ruth resting: 3, (4) Ruth rewarded: 4. The events recorded in Ruth cover a period of 10 years (Ussher)

\textbf{1 \& 2 Samuel}
\end{center}
1 SAMUEL represents the personal history of Samuel, last of the Judges. It records the moral failure of the priesthood under Eli, and of the Judges in Samuel's attempt to make the office hereditary (1 Samuel 8:1). In his prophetic office Samuel was faithful, and in him begins the line of writing prophets. Henceforth the prophet, not the priest, is conspicuous in Israel. In this book the theocracy, as exercised through judges, ends (1 Samuel 8:7), and the line of kings begins with Saul. As First Samuel marks the failure of man in Eli, Saul, and even Samuel, so 2 SAMUEL marks the restoration of order through the enthroning of God's king, David. This book also records the establishment of Israel's political centre in Jerusalem (2 Samuel 5:6-12), and her religious centre in Zion (2 Samuel 5:7, 6:1-17). When all was thus ordered, Jehovah established the great Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 27:8-17) out of which all kingdom truth is henceforth developed. David, in his ``last words'' (2 Samuel 23:1-7), describes the millennial kingdom yet to be.
